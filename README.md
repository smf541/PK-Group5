# PK Model

This repository contains a Python library for specifying, solving and visualising a pharmacokinetic model. 

#TODO: Write equations and describe how the pharmacokinetic model works (based on project description).

## About 

PK Model is a useful library for quantitatively describing the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of a drug through a patient's system. 

The patient's body is modelled as one or more kinetically homogenous compartments into which a drug is initially administered and moves through over time. This easy-to-use package then enables the drug quantity in each comparment to be tracked and visualised at different time points. 

(https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\frac{\mathrm{d}&space;q_{c}}{\mathrm{d}&space;t}=&space;Dose\left&space;(&space;t&space;\right&space;)-&space;\frac{q^{_{c}}}{V_{c}}CL&space;-&space;Q_{p1}\left&space;(&space;\frac{q_{c}}{V_{c}}&space;-&space;\frac{q_{p1}}{V_{p1}}\right&space;))

The model is highly versatile, enabling users to alter parameters such as drug dosage, delivery strategy, the time span over which the drug is delivered, and more.


PK Model is an up-and-coming Python package that strives to make pharmacokinetic modelling intuitive and user-friendly by providing a simple yet powerful model of drug delivery. 



## Using the PK Model library

#TODO: Add usage example once classes and functions are defined.

## Installing PK Model
#TODO: Make PKModel pip installable

PK Model is compatible with Python versions 3.6+. 

To install the latest release of the PK Model library, simply type the following command into the console:

```bash
python -m pip install --extra-index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ pkmodel
```

If you wish to uninstall the library, you can do so using the following command:

```bash
pip uninstall PKModel
```

## Package Documentation 

Our API Reference and User Guide is available on [Read the Docs](https://pk-model.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ "PK Model Documentation")
